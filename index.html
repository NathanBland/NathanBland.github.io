        <h3>Passions</h3>
        <p> I'm an aspiring developer nearing graduation from college. My passions range from software development, to backpacking, to Jeeping.</p>
        <p>I enjoy pretty much everything about technology, and try to use it to its full potential.</p>
        <p>My favorite part of technology is making things and tinkering with how they work, whether its making a simple static site like this or some more complex technologies.</p>
        <p>Side projects are one of my favorite hobbies, and you can check a few of them out on my <a href="https://github.com/NathanBland">gitHub</a> account.</p>

        <h2 class="heading"><i class="fa fa-code"></i> My Work</h2>
        <p>During my collegiate career I've had the opportunity to do several internships at some great companies. </p>
        <p>The first company I worked for as an intern was <a href="http://catalystsecure.com/">Catalyst Repository Systems</a> during the summer of 2013. While I was there I worked as a Product Support Developer, and got to learn Python and WSGI along the way. This was an awesome enviornment to work in, and I had a great boss. I also enjoyed working in Denver, Colorado; which is where they are located.</p>
        <p>In the summer of 2014 I stayed in Lincoln, Nebraska to do an internship at the small start-up company <a href="http://www.complytrax.com/">ComplyTrax</a>. Here I worked along with the head developer to work on the middleware and front end of their system. The primary technology stack at ComplyTrax was ASP.NET web forms, and a major project during my time there was refractoring to ASP.NET MVC.</p>
        <p>During my time as a student at <a href="https://www.ucollege.edu/">Union College</a> I've also worked to help start a technology club on campus. My role in this club was to help plan programming events such as hackathons. We also partnered with a local school to volunteer teaching programming to students K-12.</p>
