## I love the Outdoors

There are few things in the world I enjoy more than going out into nature. My personal favorite location is the mountain ranges of Colorado. Up there, the world seems at peace. Issues from projects, or troubled relationships seem to all fade into nothingness as the cool breeze through the trees carry your worries away. 

That's not to say these mountains don't deserve respect, but they don't. Instead they demand it. Failing to pay attention up there can be deadly, yet the mountains and their valleys below seem to have a way of calming the soul. Understanding that they need to be respected only adds to their beauty and value. Being in a place that so few of the worlds 6+ billion people will ever get to be in leaves a humbling feeling flowing through your heart.

The sign below from [Copper Mountain](http://www.coppercolorado.com/winter/index.html)'s high alpine terrian says it best.

That area of Copper is awesome, and a lot of fun, but demands that you pay attention. Its this aspect of balance that I love about the mountains and all of the activities that can be done in them.

### From skiing to backpacking. I Love it all.
